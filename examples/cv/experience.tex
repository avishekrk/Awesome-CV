        \item { \textbf{Overdraft Early Warning System (Mint): }Built and deployed a machine learning system to predict when customer are likely to overdraft and prevent the overdraft through an email notification. The feature saved customer 12 million dollars in a single year and was featured in CNET. }
        \item { \textbf{Transaction Categorization (Mint): } (Tech Lead) Revamped the current Mint Transaction Categorization by developing a new BERT based model. This modoel enabled the first Venmo and Zelle support as well as increase the accuracy of the model overall. }
         \item { \textbf{Forecasting for Personal Finance (Mint): } (Tech Lead) Led a team of three data scientists to develop an RNN-based forecasting model to forecast future spending of Mint customers.}
         \item { \textbf{Dynamic Upsell (TurboTax): Built a model to select if a customer should be shown an upsell or not in TurboTax. The model decreased churn due to upsell fatigue by suppressing upsells for customers the least likely to take them. }}

        \item { \textbf{Retention of HIV Patients in Medical Care (Healthcare): }Created a risk assessment tool to predict which HIV+ patients are likely to drop out of care for use by the University of Chicago HIV clinic and Chicago Department of Public Health.}
        \item { \textbf{Prevention of Childhood Lead Poisoning (Healthcare): }Deployed a machine learning model for predicting which homes in the city of Chicago are likely to have lead hazards that lead to early childhood lead poisoning. This work was in  partnership with the Chicago Department of Public Health, the Chicago Department of Innovation and Technology and Alliance HealthCare, awarded the Academy Health Local/State Innovation Prize.}
         \item { \textbf{Preventing Water Main Breaks (City Planning): }Built and deployed a machine learning system to identify which city blocks are most at risk of having water main breaks for the city of Syracuse, NY. This work has been featured in State Scoop, Water Online, and Politico and replicated in several cities as well as published in KDD.}
         \item { \textbf{The Cost of Technical Recidivism (Criminal Justice): }Developed a point-of-service model for predicting general recidivism for the Illinois Department of Corrections. Conducted a retrospective study to understand the effect of technical recidivism violations on an offender's ability to obtain future employment.}
         \item{ \textbf{Executive Training: }Wrote and taught the curriculum for the Coleridge Initiative, a 3-month long course to train the heads of city and state government agencies on the use of data science methods to solve public policy problems.}
